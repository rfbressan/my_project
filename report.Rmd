## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Package `targets` can handle literate programming (i.e., lightweight dependency-aware R Markdown reports) inside the individual target of a pipeline. An R Markdown report as part of a target should be
lightweight: mostly prose, minimal code, fast execution, and no output other than the rendered final document, like this example.

We begin by loading the `targets` package in order to access its functions like `tar_read()` and `tar_load()`. Then, we are able to call on previously computed targets.

```{r}
library(targets)
```

```{r hello-dt}
tar_load(hello_dt)
hello_dt
```
